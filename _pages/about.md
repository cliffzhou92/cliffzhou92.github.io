I am a tenure-track Assistant Professor at the [Center for Machine Learning Research](https://cmlr.pku.edu.cn/About/Introduction/index.htm) and [Center for Quantitative Biology](https://cqb.pku.edu.cn/info/1002/2869.htm) at Peking University, Beijing, China.

I obtained my B.S.(2014) and Ph.D.(2019) in Computational Mathematics from School of Mathematical Sciences, Peking University, supervised by Professor [Tiejun Li](http://dsec.pku.edu.cn/~tieli/). I used to be a visiting graduate student in Mathematics Department, University of California, Irvine in 2018. Starting from 2012, I also served as the research assistant in the lab of Professor [Fangting Li](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Fangting_Li), from Center for Quantitative Biology, Peking University. My dissertation is titled *Rare Event Studies in Single-Cell Systems Biology*. After graduation in 2019, I started my postdoc at UC Irvine, USA under the supervision of Professor [Qing Nie](https://faculty.sites.uci.edu/qnie/), and became the Visiting Assistant Professor of mathematics department from 2020 to 2023.

I joined Peking University as a faculty starting from July 2023. My research interests lie at the intersection between applied mathematics and quantitative biology. Especially I am interested in combining both the mathematical and the machine intelligence to study single-cell biological data science. I'm working on incorporating the wisdom of **computational systems biology** (e.g. techniques in dynamical system modeling and applied stochastic analysis) into the analysis of emergent **single-cell multi-omics data** with the aid of **cutting-edge AI tools**, toward a better understanding of cell-fate decision process across multiple temporal and spatial scales.
