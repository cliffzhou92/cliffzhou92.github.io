Born in Beijing, China, I lived in this city for 27 years, and obtained my B.S.(2014) and Ph.D.(2019) in Computational Mathematics from School of Mathematical Sciences, Peking University, supervised by Professor [Tiejun Li](http://dsec.pku.edu.cn/~tieli/). I used to be a visiting graduate student in Mathematics Department, University of California, Irvine in 2018. Starting from 2012, I also served as the research assistant in the lab of Professor [Fangting Li](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Fangting_Li), from Center for Quantitative Biology, Peking University. My dissertation is titled "Rare Event Studies in Single-Cell Systems Biology".

After graduation, I started my postdoc at UC Irvine under the supervision of Professor [Qing Nie](https://faculty.sites.uci.edu/qnie/), and became the visiting assistant professor of mathematics since 2020.

My research interests lie at the intersection between mathematics and quantitative biology. Especially I am interested in combining both the mathematical and the machine intelligence to study biological data science. I'm working on incorporating the wisdom of computational systems biology (e.g. techniques in dynamical system modeling and applied stochastic analysis) into the analysis of emergent single-cell omics data, toward a better understanding of cell-fate decision process across multiple temporal and spatial scales in biology.
